# Name of the Folder

Longer description - give geophraphies included and years of data, if applicable.

### What's in this folder?

This is the raw data (and code if applicable) used in the Inside Energy story [Story Name](story.url)

### Where does this data come from?

Source: [Source Name](source.url)

If you have to make a query for a dataset and the source does not provide you a permalink for the table you found (like for some BLS data), you should describe the steps you took in the query to get to the data. See [what I did here](coming.soon).

### Data Dictionary

Describe the categories of the data, if they are not self-explanatory. Assume most are not, especially if you've had to do a calculation. This is where you explain any analysis you did. Such as, We divided `this-category` by `this-other-category` to get `this-third-percent-category`, the percent of something awesome. 

### Some Other Heading As Necessary

I've only done a few of these so far, so you may want to add some other kind of comments, depending on the data. Essentially, you should just think about doing everything possible to make our process and our analysis as transparent as possible.
