# Github Training - Inside Energy Retreat, 2015

In this training, we'll get you familiar with the basics of using Github.

### Um. Why?

Github is where we are hosting our central data hub, for all the stories we've done since IE began. For most stories, you'll be working in [this repository](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/Data-for-stories), though larger projects will have their own repos. For now, though, I'll just be teaching you how to contribute to the repo for our standard data stories.

The point of all of this is to have a stardardized way for anyone to see, get and analyze for themselves the data we use in stories. You may have noticed this little doo-dad popping up on some of our graphics:

Github allows us to provide direct downloads of CSV and Excel files, as well as an explanation of the analysis behind every dataset we use. Hooray for transparency!


### Okay, so...

So, until now, I've been going back into our archives and doing this process for old stories and datasets. Now, it's your turn. After this trinaing, and with guidance from Jordan and I, you'll soon be able to do this process yourselves, for every future story you do that uses data.

### It might be confusing at first. 

It's okay if you feel like this sometimes...

Hang in there!

### We'll all get there in the end.

Much like my cat, Edgar.
