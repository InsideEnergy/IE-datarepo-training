# To Do Before the Retreat

### Hello Inside Energy reporters!

Welcome to data repository and Github training. Before our main session at the retreat, we need everyone to get set up with Github so that we can hit the ground running. I'll ask you to do three quick things before we all get to North Dakota.

### 1. Set up your Github account. 

Inside Energy has its own [Github account](http://github.com/insideenergy/). But IE on Github is an organization, not a user. So in order to contribute to our main data repository that's housed on the IE account, you all will need your own personal accounts. You'll push stuff to the data hub in this way. 

So! Go to: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join), and make your account. (Your username can be whatever; mine is the same as my Twitter handle for simplicity's sake.)

You'll be asked to choose your plan. Just go with the default setting - a free account. All that means is that everything you do is public (no private repositories). That fits with our general ethos of transparency, anyhow.

### 2. Donwload the Github desktop app.

Go [here for Mac](https://mac.github.com/).
Go [here for PC](https://windows.github.com/).

After you install the app, launch it, and enter the credentials you just created. (If it then asks you to put in additional "enterprise" credentials, just skip that step.)

Voila! You're now ready to use Github, with an easy desktop interface. This means you won't have to use the Command Line, which often makes me feel like poor ol' Mr. Arnold.

### 3. Send me your new info. 

Send me **your new Github username**, so that I can add you as a collaborator on the two repos we'll be playing with over the retreat. Also send me **whether you use PC or Mac**.
